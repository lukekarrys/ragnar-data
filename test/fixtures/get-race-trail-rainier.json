Our new venue (which will replace Ragnar Trail Cascades), is located at Crystal Mountain, less than two hours from Seattle. Dubbed Ragnar Trail Rainier-WA, this race features views of mountain lakes, Mt. Rainier and&nbsp;fresh-scented evergreen trees. Grab your team of 8 runners (or ultra-team of 4 runners), and get ready for an unforgettable overnight trail running relay. Not sure how it works? Teams start Friday, and run relay-style, on three different trails, or &ldquo;loops,&rdquo; through the night, and into Saturday, until each member has completed all three loops. When you&rsquo;re not running you&rsquo;ll enjoy the party-vibe at Ragnar Village, roast s&rsquo;mores, camp under billions of stars, sleep (maybe), and wait for your turn to run again, and again. Ragnar Trail Relays are like summer camp for adults, with lots of trail running, and no curfew. Mark your running calendar for Aug. 18 -19, we&rsquo;ll see you at Crystal Mountain!</p>\n","waiver":"","home":"<p style=\"line-height: 23.1111px;\">Ragnar Trail Cascades-WA presented by Salomon is&nbsp;an overnight trail running relay created for those with an adventurous spirit.

say, &ldquo;what goes up in the Mt.Rainier Gondola must come down via the Northway Trail&rdquo;. Seriously, you get to ride a Gondola to the top! Don&rsquo;t consider it cheating. Do ski jumpers consider the elevator ride cheating? Think about that on the 12 minute ride that climbs over 2,000&rsquo;, but at the top, be prepared to meet Spectacular. In this case, Spectacular is a 360 degree view of the Cascades, fields of wildflowers, and ohhhh&hellip;that view of Mount Rainier. Did the wind make your eyes weep or are those tears of joy? Pick your jaw up and start moving. The first mile runs on a dirt road along the ridge of Crystal Mountain Resort. It is a good things the road is wide because you&rsquo;ll keep cranking your neck back to get more of that view. Pretty soon you settle into a good pace as the road turns to single-track and that&rsquo;s when things get really good. This trail is so good, so beautiful, the views so amazing, that we aren&rsquo;t even going to on about it.

This loop is our most sustained climb of the Ragnar Trail Series. 2,638&rsquo; feet of climbing. The good thing is, that gain is spread out over 5 miles. What, that didn&rsquo;t make it sound better? It starts with a hard climb with the Green Loop for about half a mile and then, when Green splits away, it mellows out and you get the chance to see across the valley and up the ridgeline to where you are headed. WAAAAAYYYYYY up there. Then things punch you in the gut again for another mile of climbing before yet another mellow section brings you to the shores of crystal clear Henskin Lake. From here the pitch starts rolling through meadows as you cut across mid-mountain and eventually under the Forest Queen lift. After that, things get steep again. Switchbacks take you up through Powder Bowl to gain the ridgeline. Your quads are burning and as your vision returns you realize the views. The last half mile grant you a view that you worked for, but it was worth it. Now you can have a seat in that gondola and watch the fresh looking Yellow Loop runners bolt out down the ridgeline. They didn&rsquo;t earn it. You did. Well done my friend.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","elevation_gain":"451.89","elevation_gain_m":"137.74","elevation_loss":"-2902.93","elevation_loss_m":"-884.81","overall_distance":"0.00","adjusted_distance":"0.00","gpx":"Rainier

Our new venue (which will replace Ragnar Trail Cascades), is located at Crystal Mountain, less than two hours from Seattle. Dubbed Ragnar Trail Rainier-WA, this race features views of mountain lakes, Mt. Rainier and fresh-scented evergreen trees. Grab your team of 8 runners (or ultra-team of 4 runners), and get ready for an unforgettable overnight trail running relay. Not sure how it works? Teams start Friday, and run relay-style, on three different trails, or &ldquo;loops,&rdquo; through the night, and into Saturday, until each member has completed all three loops. When you&rsquo;re not running you&rsquo;ll enjoy the party-vibe at Ragnar Village, roast s&rsquo;mores, camp under billions of stars, sleep (maybe), and wait for your turn to run again, and again. Ragnar Trail Relays are like summer camp for adults, with lots of trail running, and no curfew. Mark your running calendar for Aug 18-19, we&rsquo;ll see you at Crystal Mountain!
